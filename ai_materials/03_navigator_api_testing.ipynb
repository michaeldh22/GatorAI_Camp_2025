    "# UF NaviGator API Testing with Mistral-Small-3.1\n",
    "## Educational AI Language Model Integration\n",
    "\n",
    "Welcome to the third notebook in our AI series! This notebook explores how to use University of Florida's NaviGator API to access state-of-the-art language models like Mistral-Small-3.1.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 🎯 Learning Objectives\n",
    "By the end of this notebook, you will understand:\n",
    "- How to authenticate and connect to UF's NaviGator API\n",
    "- How to use OpenAI-compatible APIs for language models\n",
    "- How to craft effective prompts for different tasks\n",
    "- How to integrate language models into game applications\n",
    "- Best practices for API usage and error handling\n",
    "\n",
    "### 🚀 What is NaviGator?\n",
    "NaviGator is University of Florida's AI platform that provides access to powerful language models for research and educational purposes. It uses an OpenAI-compatible API, making it easy to integrate with existing tools and workflows.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 🎮 Game Integration Potential\n",
    "In our farming game, we can use language models for:\n",
    "- **Dynamic NPC Dialogue**: Generate contextual responses based on player actions\n",
    "- **Quest Generation**: Create unique missions and storylines\n",
    "- **Educational Content**: Provide farming tips and explanations\n",
    "- **Emotion-Aware Responses**: Adapt dialogue based on detected player emotions"
